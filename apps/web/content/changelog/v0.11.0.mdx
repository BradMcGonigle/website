The site now features subtle animated backgrounds that rotate every 8 hours, giving returning visitors a fresh visual experience.

## Backgrounds

Two canvas-based backgrounds are currently available:

- **Dot Grid** - A pulsing grid of dots that fades from the top of the page
- **Topographic** - Animated contour lines using Perlin noise

## How It Works

- Backgrounds rotate every 8 hours (3 times per day)
- Selection persists during your session for consistency while navigating
- Adapts to light/dark theme automatically
- Renders behind all content with no impact on interactivity
