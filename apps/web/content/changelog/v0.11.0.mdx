The site now features subtle animated backgrounds that rotate every 8 hours, giving returning visitors a fresh visual experience.

## Backgrounds

Seven canvas-based backgrounds are currently available:

- **Dot Grid** - A pulsing grid of dots that fades from the top of the page
- **Topographic** - Animated contour lines using Perlin noise
- **Flow Field** - Particles following noise-based flow patterns
- **Constellation** - Connected stars with twinkling and shooting stars
- **Wave Interference** - Overlapping circular wave patterns
- **Aurora** - Flowing ribbon-like aurora borealis effect
- **Voronoi** - Animated Voronoi cell diagram with drifting points

## How It Works

- Backgrounds rotate every 8 hours (3 times per day)
- Selection persists during your session for consistency while navigating
- Adapts to light/dark theme with reduced opacity in light mode
- Renders behind all content with no impact on interactivity
