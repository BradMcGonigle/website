Added a new **Links** section for sharing interesting articles, tools, and resources discovered around the web.

## Links Page

- New `/links` route displaying saved links in a card grid layout
- Each link shows title, description, image (if available), date, and tags
- Links open in new tabs and are sorted by date (newest first)

## Save Links API

Created an API endpoint at `/api/links` that:

- Accepts a URL and optional tags
- Fetches the page and extracts metadata (title, description, OG image)
- Generates an MDX file and commits it to GitHub automatically
- Protected with an API key for security

## Bookmarklet Tool

Added a bookmarklet in `tools/link-bookmarklet/` for quickly saving links:

- **Desktop**: One-click bookmarklet that sends the current page to the API
- **iOS**: Instructions for creating a Shortcut that appears in the Share Sheet
- Simple HTML setup page for generating personalized bookmarklets

## Technical Details

- New `links` Velite collection with schema for title, description, url, image, date, and tags
- New `pages.links-list` package for the links page component
- API route uses GitHub API to create content files directly
