Enhanced the homepage with smooth entrance animations for a more polished feel.

## Animations

- Staggered fade-in animations for homepage sections
- Smooth transitions as elements enter the viewport
- Responsive to user scroll position

## Technical Details

Implemented using pure CSS and native browser APIs:

- CSS keyframes and transitions for animations
- Custom `useInView` hook using Intersection Observer API
- Zero external dependencies (~50KB bundle size reduction vs framer-motion)
- Follows the principle of preferring native browser APIs when functionality is equivalent
