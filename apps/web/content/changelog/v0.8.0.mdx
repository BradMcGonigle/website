Added a streamlined workflow for saving interesting links directly from the browser.

## Bookmarklet

A browser bookmarklet that captures the current page and opens the link saving interface:

- One-click capture of page URL, title, and metadata
- Opens `/links/new` with pre-filled information
- Works on any website you're browsing

## Links API

New API endpoints for programmatic link management:

- `/api/links/preview` - Fetches page metadata (title, description, images)
- `/api/links` - Saves links via GitHub API to create content files
- Image selection UI for choosing the best preview image
- API key authentication for protected endpoints

## Documentation

Added setup documentation in `tools/link-bookmarklet/README.md` with installation instructions.
