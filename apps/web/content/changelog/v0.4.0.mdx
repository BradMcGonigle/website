  - feature
---

Integrated [Velite](https://velite.js.org/) for managing [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) content with full TypeScript support.

## Content Collections

Three content types are now available:

1. **Blog Posts** - MDX-powered blog with frontmatter for title, description, date, and tags
2. **Projects** - Showcase for personal projects with tech stack and links
3. **Changelog** - Track site updates and version history

## Technical Implementation

- Configured Velite with [Turbopack](https://turbo.build/pack) for fast development builds
- Set up `#content` path alias for type-safe imports
- Added MDX support with [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) and [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) plugin extensibility

## Developer Experience

- Full TypeScript inference for content schemas
- Hot reloading during content development
- Automatic slug and permalink generation
