Added a new **Links** section for sharing interesting articles, tools, and resources discovered around the web.

## Links Page

- New `/links` route displaying saved links in a card grid layout
- Each link shows title, description, image (if available), date, and tags
- Links open in new tabs and are sorted by date (newest first)

## Interactive Save Link Page

New `/links/new` page for curating links with full control:

- **Preview & Edit**: Modify title, description, and tags before saving
- **Image Selection**: Browse all images found on the page
- **Screenshot Option**: Take a page screenshot using Puppeteer if no good images exist
- **Local Storage**: Images are downloaded and saved to your repo (no hotlinking)

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/links/preview` - Fetches page metadata and extracts all images
- `GET /api/links/screenshot` - Takes a page screenshot using headless Chrome
- `POST /api/links` - Downloads selected image and commits both image + MDX to GitHub

## Bookmarklet Tool

Updated bookmarklet in `tools/link-bookmarklet/`:

- **Desktop**: Opens the Save Link page in a popup for quick curation
- **iOS**: Simple Shortcut that opens Safari to the Save Link page
- HTML setup page for generating personalized bookmarklets

## Technical Details

- New `links` Velite collection with schema for title, description, url, image, date, and tags
- New `pages.links-list` package for the links page component
- Puppeteer with `@sparticuz/chromium` for serverless screenshot capability
- Images stored in `public/images/links/` for reliable long-term hosting
