The initial foundation of the personal website establishing the monorepo architecture.

## Highlights

- Configured [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) workspaces with [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) for efficient builds
- Set up [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-16) with App Router and [React 19](https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19)
- Created reusable configs for TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and Tailwind
- Established packages structure for pages, components, and utilities
- Added GitHub Actions workflow for PR checks (lint, typecheck, build)

## Technical Stack

- [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) with App Router
- [React 19](https://react.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety
- [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4) for styling
- [pnpm v10](https://pnpm.io/blog/2025/01/07/pnpm-10) with workspace catalogs
