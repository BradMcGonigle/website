Enhanced the user experience with dark mode support and improved mobile navigation.

## Dark Mode

Implemented a complete theming system with three modes:

- **Light** - Clean, bright theme for daytime use
- **Dark** - Reduced eye strain theme for low-light environments
- **System** - Automatically matches your OS preference

### Technical Details

- Theme toggle component with accessible radio group pattern
- [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) for hydration-safe theme management
- CSS variables for seamless color transitions
- [lucide-react](https://lucide.dev/) icons for theme indicators

## Mobile Navigation

Added a responsive hamburger menu for mobile devices:

- Collapsible menu that appears on screens smaller than `md` breakpoint
- Smooth open/close transitions with Menu and X icons
- Accessible with proper ARIA attributes (`aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`)
- Auto-closes when navigating to a new page

## Testing Improvements

- Added E2E tests for theme toggle functionality
- Created mobile navigation E2E test suite
- Integrated [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) HTML reports into CI summary for easier debugging
