title: "Chris Coyier: Thinking like a Front-end Developer"
description: "Let’s take a peek at what front-end development has become these days. Starting from what the role is, where we sit, and the expectations of us. Then we’ll get into the problems we face, how to approach them, and the tools we have at our disposal. We’ll look at how Gutenberg might fit into our lives as front-end developers."
