title: "Airline Logos"
description: "Mid-century airline vibes seem to be all the rage these days, with the new TWA Hotel opening up at JFK airport amid much fanfare. The red and gold TWA logo is timeless, and it’s etched in tile on the hotel pool, graces the hottest toiletry kit you’ve ever seen, and even got its own font treatment by Pentagram."
