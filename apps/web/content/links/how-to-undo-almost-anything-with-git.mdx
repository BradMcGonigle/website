title: "How to undo (almost) anything with Git"
description: "One of the most useful features of any version control system is the ability to “undo” your mistakes. In Git, “undo” can mean many slightly different things. When you make a new commit, Git stores a snapshot of your repository at that specific moment in time; later, you can use Git to go back to an earlier version of your project."
