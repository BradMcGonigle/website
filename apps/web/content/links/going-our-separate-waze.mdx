title: "Going our Separate Waze"
description: "Established in 2006, Waze is one of the most popular navigation apps in the world, with 130 million users in over 180 countries and is, in part, fueled by its community of users who report, in real time, traffic and road conditions (along with the very helpful police-up-ahead reports so that you can slow your speeding, which you shouldn’t be doing)."
