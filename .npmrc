# Security: Minimum Release Age
# ============================================================================
# Prevent installation of packages published less than 3 days ago.
# This helps protect against supply chain attacks where malicious packages
# are often detected and unpublished within hours/days of being published.
#
# Trade-off: Security patches for zero-day exploits may be delayed by 3 days.
# For urgent security updates (e.g., critical Next.js CVEs), you can:
#   1. Run: pnpm install --ignore-minimum-release-age
#   2. Or use: PNPM_IGNORE_MINIMUM_RELEASE_AGE=true pnpm install
#
# See: https://pnpm.io/settings#minimum-release-age
